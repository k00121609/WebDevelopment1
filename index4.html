                    <h2>Feature Article: Lottery’s interesting Q & A? (January 2017)</h2><h4>by Sinéad Boyce </h4>
			
<p><b>Which countries perform best on the Euro millions and why?</b></p>
                
<p>All participating countries have had Euro Million winners, but, are there, or/and what are the factors that lead to some countries having more winners than others. Is it population size, culture of buying more tickets in some countries, or is it down to sheer luck?</p>
                
<p>The main stats are that France has the most top-jackpot winners at 79, then Spain at 77, Portugal at 59 and the UK at 58. Ireland stands at 10, while Luxemburg is the lowest at 2.</p>
                
                <br>
                
<p><b>What are the factors that affect winning the Lottery?</b></p>
                
<ul>
                
<li> Population: France has a population of 64 million, while Luxemburg is at 580,000</li>
                
<li> Length of time joined in the lottery: the UK, France and Spain have joined earlier than other countries in 2004 at the when the Euro Millions started. This could be a factor in having more opportunities over time to accumulate winners.</li>
                
<li> Entry formats: some countries like Portugal have different entry systems where the lottery players select a greater amount of numbers which may increase their opportunity to attain more winning combinations of numbers. In this case, Portugal has been found to have more top-prize jackpot winners than some other participating countries with higher populations, however, their prices for purchasing tickets are higher. </li>
</ul>
                
<p>However, as per the ethos of the Euro Millions lottery it is said that despite the above factors the changes of winning in any country, with any amount of number combinations and amount of tickets purchased, chances of winning are the same, put down to luck.</p>
                
                <br>
                
<p><b>What are the most common Irish Lotto numbers?</b></p>
               
<p>Statistics gathered on the game have filtered lotto numbers and have come up with the most and least popular numbers played in the Irish Lotto. The most popular ones are reading from left to right:</p>
                <p>5, 17, 19, 29, 31, 8, 39</p>
                
                <p>The least popular numbers determined once again reading from left to right are:</p>
                <p>43, 45, 44, 41, 40, 42, 37</p>
                
However, these can vary as the amount of numbers that can be picked in lottery’s increase, so too do the amount and number types.
    
                 <br>
                
<p><b>If you won €88.5 million today, would you quit your job?</b></p>
<p>The time from when a top-jackpot winning ticket has been declared and that of when the winner is revealed is often met when what has been described as ‘lotto fever.’ It’s part of the nation’s conversation as popular as that of discussing the weather. Accordingly, everyone has an opinion on the topic of what they would do with such winnings. People are interviewed on news programs, social media goes viral, surveys are carried out and stories of winners make head-line news.</p>
                
                 <br>
                
<p><b>The Irish Times Newspaper poll has recently run a survey responding to the Irish Euromillions win of €88.5 million. The title of the survey is: ‘If you won €88 million today, would you quit your job?</b></p>
                <p>The options were:</p>
       <ul>      
<li>Yep. In an Instant</li>
<li>No, I’d keep my routine</li>
<li>I can’t decide</li>
    </ul>                 
                <p>Such is the interest in the survey as 6.4K voters participated. The results of the poll are yet to be released.</p>
                
                
                 <br>
                
<p><b>How does the allocation of Euro Million funds to good causes in Ireland work?</b></p>
                
<p>The allocation of funding from Euromillions is considered as part of the overall pot of The National Lottery. €4.9 billion of lottery funds has been allocated to good causes in Ireland with €200 million of this generated in 2016. Statistics have been released by the National Lottery that there was a 10% increase in sales for the year ending 2016 which averages out at €4 million per week being raised for such good causes.</p>
                
<p>In general, the categories allocated funding are local community projects and to individuals in societal categories of: youth, sports, recreation, amenities, welfare, arts, culture, the Irish language and national heritage. It is distributed by the Exchequer to part-finance spending on the above categories by government departments.</p>
