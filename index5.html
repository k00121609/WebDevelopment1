                    <h2>Feature Article: Lottery History (January 2017)</h2><h4>by Sinéad Boyce    </h4>
		
	<p>The first stated registered lottery in Ireland was that of the Sweepstakes in 1930, which was set up to fund hospitals as the country had very little money, emerging from Civil War and further by the Great Depression. It was also for winnings that would make people rich.</p>
                
    <p>Tickets were sold worldwide, though, not always legally. After several scandals, it was discontinued and in 1987 was replaced by a government regulated National Lottery.</p>
                
<p>The National Lottery was also widely known by its Irish name ‘An Crannchur Naisiunta,’ and started out with scratch card games. Here they were inexpensive and prizes were small, but they had great popularity. The National lottery is established in Ireland since 1989, for 27 years.
One year later, the first Irish Lotto draw took place in April 1990 putting in place a Lottery structure that we have in Ireland today.</p>
                
<p>In television history ‘Winning Streak’ established in 1990, remains the longest running lottery game shows in Europe. First presented by Mike Murphy and next Marty Whelan. Then, this programme was replaced by another called Million Euro Challenge hosted by Nicky Byrne. This did not have the same success as its former show. This and was then replaced once again by Winning Streak, who along with Sinéad Kennedy host the show every Saturday night, taking a summer break and returning to television screens every September.</p>
                
<p>Like so many money-games the National Lottery was hacked in 1992 by an accountant in Dublin. He worked out mathematically the combination of numbers and the amount of tickets to be bought to guarantee a win and won the jackpot. He was part of a syndicate who played these number and ticket combinations winning large monetary prizes. However, he was caught out and the National Lottery system was adapted to become more secure.</p>
                
<p>The latest updates to the system to help in eliminating hacking was in September 2015 the amount of numbers a player could choose was increased from 45 to 47, hence, creating new sequence possibilities.</p>
                
<p>The National Lottery has also featured in film where in 1998 ‘Waking Ned’ was released. This was about fictional Lotto winner who died before collecting his winnings. The village where he is from gets together to claim the winnings by trying to fake that Ned is still alive. It is a light good-humoured movie and shows the relationships within communities. There have been many other films worldwide about the subject of lotteries and how they can impact people’s lives such as ‘Lucky Numbers’ with Lisa Kudrow and John Travolta where a television weatherman scams a local lottery released in 2000. </p>
                
<p>Another was called ‘The Lottery’ in 2010 that is entitled a documentary. This is where four children enter a lottery that has large potential winnings. The aim is that if they win the lottery they can attend a prestigious school in New York. In terms of a documentary, it looks at a crisis in public education in this region. In fact, lottery films date, back as far as 1941 in ‘Lady from Louisiana,’ starring John Wayne where a lawyer moves to New Orleans to try and sort out a crime syndicate that is based around a lottery.</p>
                
<p>In more recent times, 
Locally, in the mid-west region, in Limerick, Dolores McNamara had a spectacular win of €115,000,000 in the Euro Millions draw in 2005. In terms of winners outside of the top-prize this region has at 45 winning tickets, the highest average €1 million or greater prize pay-out.</p>
                
<p>If things are to go in 3’s, the recent €88.5 million win is the 3rd largest Euro Millions win in Ireland to date and is the 3rd Euro Millions jackpot to be won in Ireland in the last twelve months. The distribution of locations is the current win in Dublin and the other counties which scooped the top-jackpot Euro Millions win were Carlow and Laois.</p>
