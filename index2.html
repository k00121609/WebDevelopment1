                    <h2>Feature Article: €88.5 Irish EuroMillions Win (January 2017)</h2><h4>by Sinéad Boyce    </h4>
			<p>Article 1: €88.5 Euro Million-win:
An Irish winner of the Euromillions lottery will scoop a prize of €88 million when they go next week to National Lottery Headquarters to collect the winnings. It has been revealed by National Lottery officials that there several winners of the ticket. However, it is not yet known whether this is a family syndicate.</p>

<p>Presently, the winners wish to remain anonymous. It has been thought what the delay is in the winners collecting the golden prize. However, the winners have arrived with the prize to verify the numbers and secure the ticket. The winnings themselves will only arrive in Dublin next week. The delay is due to the prize monies must be collected from the participating countries.</p>
                
<p>Originally, the ticket was thought to have been bought in Fitzpatrick’s store in Little Island, Co. Cork. The rumour went viral on news and social media. Staff at the shop had ‘champagne on ice’ as they awaited news of the winners. The rumour was that a syndicate of 34 staff at Janssen Pharmaceutical Ltd, part of the Johnson & Johnson Group in Cork which held the winning ticket.</p>
                
<p>The winning ticket was bought on Tuesday 24th January (the day of the draw) at the ‘Apple green’ service station on the M1 northbound in Lusk, Co. Dublin. The shop itself will gain €25,000 from the lottery for being the shop that sold the ticket.</p>
                
<p>Staff at ‘Apple green’ are wondering which of them sold the ticket. The manager of the shop has notified reporters that they could not check CCTV as an indication of the winner as for preservation of the winners’ identity, the time at which the ticket was sold was not revealed to the shop staff. This raises the suspense even more as the country looks on to see who are these lucky citizens.</p>
                
<p>In a spirit of winnings and celebrations this ‘Apple green’ outlet reduced petrol and diesel prices to 88 cent/ litre. As to be expected there were vehicles queueing up all day to avail of the rock bottom prices. This was to such an extent that they were sold out of diesel and petrol. The staff provided them with complimentary refreshments as they queued to avail of this offer. Interestingly there is a teen-generation of the Celtic Tiger youths who have never seen prices slashed so low, but those of another generation can recall when these prices were the norm.</p>
                
<p>It is Ireland’s tenth Euro Millions winner. This is well represented considering Irelands population being of almost 4.8 million people as per most recent 2016 statistics. This compared to the population of eight other countries participating in the Euro Millions lottery: Austria, Belgium, France, Luxemburg, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the UK. In fact, the UK can still participate in the Euro Millions with Brexit.
