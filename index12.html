An Irish winner of the Euromillions lottery will scoop a prize of €88 million when they go next week to National Lottery Headquarters to collect the winnings. It has been revealed by National Lottery officials that there several winners of the ticket. However, it is not yet known whether this is a family syndicate.

Presently, the winners wish to remain anonymous. It has been thought what the delay is in the winners collecting the golden prize. However, the winners have arrived with the prize to verify the numbers and secure the ticket. The winnings themselves will only arrive in Dublin next week. The delay is due to the prize monies must be collected from the participating countries.

		Which countries perform best on the Euro millions and why?
                
All participating countries have had Euro Million winners, but, are there, or/and what are the factors that lead to some countries having more winners than others. Is it population size, culture of buying more tickets in some countries, or is it down to sheer luck?
                
The main stats are that France has the most top-jackpot winners at 79, then Spain at 77, Portugal at 59 and the UK at 58. Ireland stands at 10, while Luxemburg is the lowest at 2.
What are the factors that affect winning the Lottery?...

 The first stated registered lottery in Ireland was that of the Sweepstakes in 1930, which was set up to fund hospitals as the country had very little money, emerging from Civil War and further by the Great Depression. It was also for winnings that would make people rich.
                
 Tickets were sold worldwide, though, not always legally. After several scandals, it was discontinued and in 1987 was replaced by a government regulated National Lottery.
                
The National Lottery was also widely known by its Irish name ‘An Crannchur Naisiunta,’ and started out with scratch card games. Here they were inexpensive and prizes were small, but they had great popularity. The National lottery is established in Ireland since 1989, for 27 years.
